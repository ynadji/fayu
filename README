== fayu - 发育 ==
fayu is a library that helps you learn Chinese. Given a character, or set of
characters, fayu will suggest new characters that will be easy to learn and
new words formed from characters you already know. For example, if you know the
character 明 (bright) and the word 星期 (week), fayu would suggest the new words
明星 (celebrity) and 星星 (star). fayu also works as the component level.
Searching for 饣 (food) would return an assortment of words containing the
radical like 饥 (starving, famine), 饭 (cooked rice, meal), and 饿 (hungry).

fayu makes heavy use of the excellent cjklib (http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/).
Eventually, fayu will be an Anki plugin so new cards can automatically be
generated based on what is currently in a user's deck.
